ColorTemperature

It is a part of [kch-rgbw-lib](https://github.com/kchinzei/kch-rgbw-lib).
See [README.md](https://github.com/kchinzei/kch-rgbw-lib/blob/master/README.md)
for general information.

### Code snippet

In TypeScript/ES2015:

```TypeScript
import { CSpace, CSpaceTypes } from 'kch-rgbw-lib';
import { CIEk2x, CIEk2y, CIExy2k, CIEfadeout, CIEfadein } from 'kch-rgbw-lib';
```

## API

### Functions

##### CIEk2x(k: number): number

##### CIEk2y(k: number): number

Return CIE-x or CIE-y value of black body corresponding to the given color temperature in K.

##### CIExy2k(xy: CSpace): number

##### CIExy2k(x: number, y: number): number

Return correlated color temperature (CCT) corresponding to CIE (x, y).
`xy` should be in 'xy' or 'xyY' of `CSpaceTypes`.
Other types will throw an exception.
Optimized McCamy's approximation is used. Note that returned CCT is
physically meaningful only when (x, y) is on or near the white light.
In particular, the area between blue and red is very inaccurate as shown
in the color mapping of the returned temperature.

Although CCT by McCamy's approximation is known that it's isotherms are
[less accurate than other methods](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spacesXYZ/vignettes/isotherms.pdf),
it gives the smallest error in [1000, 7000] k according to my experiment.

##### CIEfadeout(xy0: CSpace, steps: number, fade?: (r: number) => number): CSpace[]

##### CIEfadein(xy:0 CSpace, steps: number, fade?: (r: number) => number): CSpace[]

Return array of CSpace, filling with interpolated points starting/ending
at xy0.
`xy0` should be in 'xy' or 'xyY' of `CSpaceTypes`.
Other types will throw an exception.
`CIEfadeout()` ends / `CIEfadein()` starts at the point where
color temperature is 1000 K.
`fade()` is a function used to interpolate between the start and end points.
`fade()` is called repeatedly with changing `r` from 0 to 1, like:

```typescript
const p: CSpace[] = new Array(steps) as CSpace[];
for (let i=0; i<steps; i++) {
  const r = fade(i / steps);
  (interpolate start (x,y) and end (x,y) by r)
  (interpolate colorTemperature of (x,y) and 1000 by r)
  p[i] = { interpolated x, y, k };
}
```

It is intended to mimicking lamp gradually turning off/on.

Note: when (x,y) is far from the black body curve, it behaves odd,
due to the limitation of `CIExy2k()`.
